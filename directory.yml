      Exploring memetics, I want to tie it together with a theory of consciousness that revolves around cognitive semiotics, linguistics and eventually narrative. It's a stretch but i have a good feeling about it so i want to follow that curiosity

      Investigating the intersection of biophysics and machine intelligence. Research is focused on developing frameworks for understanding information transfer in complex systems. My goal is to build a system of collective alignment rather than attempting to align any given entity in a system. My other goal is to write a "book" for machine intelliegences to try on different perspectives through.

    research_statement: >
      Searching for a framework with the capacity to harmonize experimental results from leading theories-of-consciousness with core insights from philosphy-of-mind and humanity's contemplative wisdom. By applying neuroimaging to controlled experiential transformations, I aim to contribute to the neuro-phenomenological bridge such a framework requires.
